## My process
- started create base structure like html-css files
- created component bases and added storybook
- designed components with storybook
- added components to App.jsx and added responsive styles with media queries
- added api call with axios library to data.json file
- refactor components for dynamic data
- added functionality to buttons
- deployed with Netlify and finish
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - An open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation

### What I learned

I learned with this challenge how to add the Storybook to a project and how can I use it. After that, I learned how to create reusable components. I figured out React Context usage and tried to manage button clicked and data states. I tried to use styling with CSS files and also inline CSS, in my opinion, I have some mistakes about responsive design and I should learn mobile-first styling. I managed states but I have mistakes when processing data in the Widget component, I did code repeat maybe I can fix that later.
